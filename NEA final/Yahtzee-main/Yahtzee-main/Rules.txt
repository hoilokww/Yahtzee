Rules

The Objective of Yahtzee is to achieve the highest possible total score. 

The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in each category.
The score is determined by a different rule for each category.

The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored.

Game Start

To start with, roll all the dice. After rolling you can either score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the dice.

You may only roll the dice a total of 3 times - the initial roll and two rerolls. After rolling 3 times you must choose a category to score.

Scoring

Once you have the dice face combination you want to score, you score the roll in one of the 13 categories.
You do this by clicking on one of the radio buttons in either the Upper Scores or Lower Scores box. Once a category has been scored, it is closed out for the rest of the game
You cannot change a category's score once it's been set.
Each category defines its own scoring rules, as described below.

Upper Scores

In the upper scores, you total only the specified die face. So if you roll:

    1,3,3,3,5 and score in the Threes category, your total for the category would be 9.

    1,3,3,3,5 and score in the Fives category, your score would be 5.

    1,3,3,3,5 and score in the Fours category, your score would be 0.

If you roll:

    2,4,4,5,5 and score in the Fours category, your total for the category would be 8.

    2,4,4,5,5 and score in the Fives category, your score would be 10.

    2,4,4,5,5 and score in the Sixes category, your score would be 0.

Upper Bonus

If the total of Upper Scores is 63 or more, add a bonus of 35 points.

Lower Scores

In the lower scores, you score either a set amount, or zero if you don't satisfy the category requirements.

3 of Kind

Score the total of all the dice. So if you roll:

    3,3,3,4,5 you would score 18 in the 3 of Kind category.

    3,3,4,5,6 you would score 0 in the 3 of Kind category.

4 of Kind

Score the total of all the dice. So if you roll:

    3,3,3,3,5 you would score 17 in the 4 of Kind category.

    3,3,3,5,6 you would score 0 in the 4 of Kind category.

Full House

Score 25 points for a full house. A full house is where you have 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind. So if you roll:

    3,3,3,5,5 you would score 25 in the Full House category.

    2,2,5,5,5 you would score 0 in the Full House category.

Small Straight

Score 30 points for a small straight. A small straight is a sequence of four consecutive dice, such as:

    1,2,3,4,6

    2,3,4,5,3

    5,4,3,2,1

Large Straight

Score 40 points for a large straight. A large straight is a sequence of five consecutive dice, such as:

    1,2,3,4,5

    2,3,4,5,6

    6,5,4,3,2

Yahtzee

Score 50 points for a yahtzee. You must have five of a kind in order to score in the yahtzee category;
But you may optionally score in another category first if it is more advantageous.

Chance

You can roll anything and be able to put it in the Chance category. Score the total of all the dice. So if you roll:

    1,1,3,3,6 you would score 14 in the Chance category.

    4,5,5,6,6 you would score 26 in the Chance category.

    1,1,1,1,3 you would score 7 in the Chance category.

    5,6,6,6,6 you would score 29 in the Chance category.

Yahtzee Bonus

If you roll a second Yahtzee in a game, and you scored your first yahtzee in the Yahtzee box, you would score a further bonus 100 points in the yahtzee box.
You must also put this roll into another category, as follows;

    If the corresponding Upper section category is not filled then you must score there.

    If the corresponding Upper section category is filled you may then score in any other unused category.

    If the corresponding Upper section category is filled and all the other categories are filled you must score a zero in an unused Upper section category.

    Note that if you score a second yahtzee in a game and you have already scored a zero in the Yahtzee box, you do not receive a Yahtzee bonus.
